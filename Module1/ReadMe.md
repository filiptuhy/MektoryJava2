####Debugging
Import the project Debugging in Module 1. 
Use the Debugger built into your IDE to find and fix all the bugs in the code. 

*Tips*
* Use breakpoints to pause execution when the code reaches a certain statement in your code.
* Inspect variables to make sure that the code is doing what it's supposed to.
* Your debugger isn't the only debugging tool you have. Rubber duckys can be super helpful :)
